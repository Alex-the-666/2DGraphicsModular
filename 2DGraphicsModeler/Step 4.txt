3. Render Area
Display all graphic objects (i.e. shapes including text) in rendering
window. 

The shape id will be displayed above each shape identifying
it. 
The rendering area to display shapes must have minimum
dimensions of 1000 pixels (horizontal) by 500 pixels (vertical). 

The coordinate system is defined such that the top left corner of the
rendering area is located at point (0,0), the bottom right corner at
point (1000,500).
4.Your program should read from a shape file that keeps track of all
shapes currently being rendered by the 2D modeler. 

Shapes are identified by their type: line, polyline, polygon, rectangle, ellipse,
text. 

Shapes have properties: shape dimensions, pen color, pen
width, pen style, pen cap style, pen join style, brush color, brush
shape. 

Text has properties: shape dimensions, text string, text 
color, text alignment, text point size, text font family, text font
style, text font weight. 

All shapes must also have a unique ID.

5.Your program should be able to move shapes, including text, being
rendered. This is accomplished via a move shape form. 

All changes
are visible in the rendering area. – administrator only

6. Add or remove shapes visible in render area

7.Shape listing reports by id with all shape properties

8.Shape list by area

9.Shape list by perimeter
